## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I guess one of the things I learnt was how to import a font-style from google fonts. that is , after struggling for several minutes.
```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Figtree:ital,wght@0,300..900;1,300..900&display=swap');
```
I also learned how to make use of flexbox centering and that you could set the size of a container to its largest single element by setting the flex basis to 0px.
```css
    .card{
       flex-basis: 0;
    }
```




### Continued development

I guess I could get more into responsize design. I haven't really gotten a hang of it .
### Useful resources

- [a Css tricks article on flexbox](css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me for the flex basis issue. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [a stack overflow comment on importing fonts](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14676613/how-to-import-google-web-font-in-css-file) - This is what I used to finally get how to import fonts. It was confusing at first lol.
