### What I learned

I guess one of the things I learnt was how to import a font-style from google fonts. that is , after struggling for several minutes.
```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Figtree:ital,wght@0,300..900;1,300..900&display=swap');
```
I also learned how to make use of flexbox centering and that you could set the size of a container to its largest single element by setting the flex basis to 0px.
```css
    .card{
       flex-basis: 0;
    }
```


If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

I guess I could get more into responsize design. I haven't really gotten a hang of it .
### Useful resources

- [a Css tricks article on flexbox](css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me for the flex basis issue. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.

**Note: Delete this note and replace the list above with resources that helped you during the challenge. These could come in handy for anyone viewing your solution or for yourself when you look back on this project in the future.**
